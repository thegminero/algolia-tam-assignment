*Question 1*  

 
From: marissa@startup.com  
Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Answer to Q1

Hi Marissa,

I'm sorry to hear that our new dashboard design has brought you this inconvenience, I will make sure that our product team receives your feedback. On the other hand, we can probably help you reduce the amount of effort requried to delete indexes recursivelly based on your requirements (probably through the use of a script). Please let us know what date and time would best suit you in order for us to help you with alternatives to managing your indexes.

Best regards,

Guillaume Minero

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Answer to Q2.

Hi Carrie,

It looks like some of your users might have reached the size limit of their posted reviews. For more on this particular problem, feel free to review our knowledge base article [Is there a size limit for my index/records?](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406981897617-Is-there-a-size-limit-for-my-index-records-).

However, for us to further investigate and follow up I went ahead and created a support ticket #1234567.

Do you have the page link used where users post reviews? this way we can attempt and reproduce the issue (to help determine the root cause).
If there are any other details you can share, such as a sample post shared by one of your users when they got the error, it would greatly help us in our investigation. 

Additionally, If you would like to hop on a call to review the issue and discuss different approaches to deal with this, let me know your availability at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Guillaume Minero
